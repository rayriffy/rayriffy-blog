Installation & Usage
--------------------

### 1. Configure Contentful

Create a workspace and **import content model** with [this](content/model/contentful.json) provided JSON files.

Then, create **at least** one entitly of each content model and **create an API Key** in order to get Access Token and Space ID.

### 2. Configure app

Pull a source first

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/rayriffy/rayriffy-blog
```

Then install its dependencies

```sh
$ yarn
```

Finally customize your own favicon [here](static/favicon.ico) and [here](content/assets/logo.png), [logo](src/app/components/logo.tsx) and [site metadata](gatsby-config.js)

### 2. Developing

For development environment, we can use **Content Preview API - access token** to fetch contents

```sh
$ export CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=<SPACE ID HERE>
$ export CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<PREVIEW TOKEN HERE>
$ yarn dev
```

Then develop it as you wish cause it is MIT license!

### 3. Deploying

In order to deploy them to production, we use `CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID` and `CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN` as same as developing but in this case access token will be **Content Delivery API - access token**

```sh
$ export CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=<SPACE ID HERE>
$ export CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<DEPLOY TOKEN HERE>
$ yarn build
```

After build process is completed, you can use `public/` directory for publishing deployment.
